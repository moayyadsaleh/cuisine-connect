This repository includes a simple recipe finder web app.

This is a web application for searching recipes based on various parameters. It utilizes a modern tech stack, including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and API integration. The application provides a user-friendly interface for searching recipes, displaying detailed recipe information, and handling errors gracefully.

Key Features:
- Searches for recipes using multiple parameters
- Retrieves recipe data from the Spoonacular API
- Displays recipe details, including summary, ingredients, preparation steps, and more
- Handles API errors and display meaningful error messages
- Built with responsive CSS and HTML for optimal user experience

Tech Stack:
I styled the application using CSS and bootstrap  to create an appealing and intuitive interface.
I structured the web page and content using HTML to ensure proper semantics and organization.
I utilized Node.js and express js as the server-side JavaScript runtime to handle server operations and business logic.
Utilized Node.js and Express.js to communicate with the Spoonacular API, fetching recipe data and integrating it into the application's functionality.
Implemented some error handling mechanisms in JavaScript to handle errors that may occur during API calls or data processing.
